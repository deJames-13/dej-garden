> [!NOTE] Definition
> - Controllers are responsible for processing incoming **requests**, interacting with **data models** (such as databases), and preparing the appropriate **response** to send back to the client.
> 

#Example 

```js
  // @desc    Get all users
  // route    GET /api/users
  // @access  Public
  export const getUsers = async (req, res) => {
    // do something with req and res
  }
```

*Import in routes,* 
```js
import * as userController from '../controllers/userController.js';
// * means it is importing all the exported value and will be passed as a property of userController
```

*then use it as call back function in routes*
```js
userRouter
  .get('/users', userController.getUsers)
```
