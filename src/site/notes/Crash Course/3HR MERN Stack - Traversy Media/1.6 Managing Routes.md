This is similar to file structuring (See [[Crash Course/3HR MERN Stack - Traversy Media/File Structuring/Organizing Imports\|Organizing Imports]]) where you group related routes into separate files and *import them together* as one router file.

> [!TIP] `ris:Folder` Routes
> Create a `ðŸ“‚routes` folder with `index.js` and handle all separate routes file together.
> ```js
> import { Router } from 'express';
import userRouter from './userRoutes.js';
>// import more route files
>
const router = Router();
>
>// format ({prefix: String}, {router: Router})
router.use('/users', userRouter);
>// use more routes
>
>//export as one root router
export default router;
> ```

#### Explanation
- `userRoutes.js` - is a separate route file that handles user endpoints only.
- `Router` - is a class to create a router path for the server
- using the `use()` function, the `userRoute` can be added to the root `router` for the server

*Now the exported `router`* *can be used in the main file (`server.js`), like so:*
```js
Â  app.use('/api', router);
```
### Usage
- now we can access the users endpoint using `/api/users/{path}`, as we use the `'/api'` as the last route prefix and then `'/users'` as its child route

***Practice this to other routers for consistent programming**.*
