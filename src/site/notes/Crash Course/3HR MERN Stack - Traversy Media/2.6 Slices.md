> [!TIP] `ris:Folder` Slices 
> Create a slices folder to manage all the slices there. See [[Crash Course/3HR MERN Stack - Traversy Media/File Structuring/Organizing Imports\|Organizing Imports]] for proper file management.


> [!NOTE] Slice
> In Redux Toolkit, a "***slice***" is a collection of Redux reducer logic and actions for a specific feature of your application. It is a way to organize your Redux state management code in a modular and maintainable manner.

### Purpose of Slices:

1. **Encapsulation**: Slices encapsulate the state and the reducers that operate on that state, making it easier to manage and reason about.
2. **Simplified Code**: Slices reduce boilerplate code by combining actions and reducers in a single file.
3. **Modularity**: Each slice manages a specific part of the state, promoting modularity and separation of concerns.
4. **Automatic Action Creators**: Redux Toolkit automatically generates action creators based on the reducer functions defined in the slice.

```js
import { createSlice } from '@reduxjs/toolkit';

const userInfo = window.localStorage.getItem('userInfo');
const initialState = {
  userInfo: userInfo ? JSON.parse(userInfo) : null,
};

const authSlice = createSlice({
  name: 'auth',
  initialState,
  reducers: {
    setCredentials: (state, action) => {
      state.userInfo = action.payload;
      localStorage.setItem('userInfo', JSON.stringify(action.payload));
    },
    logout: (state) => {
      state.userInfo = null;
      localStorage.removeItem('userInfo');
    },
  },
});

export const { setCredentials, logout } = authSlice.actions;
export default authSlice.reducer;

```

1. **Import Statement:**
    
    - `import { createSlice } from '@reduxjs/toolkit';`: This line imports the `createSlice` function from the `@reduxjs/toolkit` package. `createSlice` is a utility for creating Redux slices (reducers and actions) in a concise manner.
2. **Local Storage Initialization:**
    
    - `const userInfo = window.localStorage.getItem('userInfo');`: This line retrieves the value associated with the key `'userInfo'` from the browser’s local storage. If the value exists, it’s stored in the `userInfo` variable; otherwise, `userInfo` is set to `null`.
3. **Initial State:**
    
    - `const initialState = { userInfo: userInfo ? JSON.parse(userInfo) : null };`: This defines the initial state for your Redux slice.
        - If `userInfo` exists (i.e., it was retrieved from local storage), it parses it from a string to an object using `JSON.parse(userInfo)`.
        - Otherwise, `userInfo` is set to `null`.
4. **Create a Redux Slice:**
    
    - `const authSlice = createSlice({ ... });`: This line creates a Redux slice named `'auth'`.
        - The `createSlice` function takes an object with the following properties:
            - `name`: The name of the slice (used for naming actions).
            - `initialState`: The initial state defined earlier.
            - `reducers`: An object containing reducer functions (actions).
5. **Reducers:**
    
    - Inside the `reducers` object:
        - `setCredentials`: This reducer updates the `userInfo` state when called. It sets `state.userInfo` to the payload received (typically an object containing user credentials) and also stores it in local storage.
        - `logout`: This reducer clears the `userInfo` state (sets it to `null`) and removes the corresponding item from local storage.
6. **Export Actions and Reducer:**
    
    - `export const { setCredentials, logout } = authSlice.actions;`: This exports the action creators (`setCredentials` and `logout`) from the slice.
    - `export default authSlice.reducer;`: This exports the reducer function itself (to be combined with other reducers in your Redux store).
7. **Usage:**
    
    - In your Redux store setup, you would combine this reducer with other reducers using `combineReducers`.
    - Components can dispatch the `setCredentials` and `logout` actions to update the state.


### Combine Reducers
- each slices contains a reducer and those reducers need to be combined into one root reducer that can be added to the main configuration of the state manager which is in the `store.js` [[Crash Course/3HR MERN Stack - Traversy Media/2.5 Redux Setup\|2.5 Redux Setup]]

`reducers.js`
```js
import { combineReducers } from '@reduxjs/toolkit';
import * as slice from './slices';

const rootReducer = combineReducers({
  auth: slice.authReducer,
  [slice.apiSlice.reducerPath]: slice.apiSlice.reducer,
});

export default rootReducer;

```
