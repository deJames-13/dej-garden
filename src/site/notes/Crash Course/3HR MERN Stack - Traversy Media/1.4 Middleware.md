> [!NOTE] Concept
> Express.js middleware functions are functions that have access to the **request** object (`req`), the **response** object (`res`), and the `next` middleware function in the application’s request-response cycle. These functions can execute any code, make changes to the request and response objects, end the request-response cycle, and call the next middleware function in the stack.

### Example
```js
// Define a middleware function
const loggerMiddleware = (req, res, next) => {
  console.log(`${req.method} ${req.url}`);
  // Call the next middleware function in the stack
  next();
};
```

### Usage
```js
// Use the middleware function in the application
app.use(loggerMiddleware);
```

- **Middleware Function:** Define a middleware function `loggerMiddleware` that logs the HTTP method and URL of each request.
- **Use Middleware:** Use the `app.use()` method to apply the middleware to all incoming requests.
- **Route Definition:** Define a basic route that responds with "Hello, World!" when accessed.
