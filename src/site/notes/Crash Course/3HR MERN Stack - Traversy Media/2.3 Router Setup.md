### Packages
```sh
npm i react-router-dom 
```



> [!NOTE] `ris:Folder`Routes
> **Create Routes folder** to manage all routes separately using `createBrowserRouter` from `reac-router-dom`. See [[Crash Course/3HR MERN Stack - Traversy Media/File Structuring/Organizing Imports\|Organizing Imports]] for more info.

### Root Router file 
- handles all the routes created in *submodules* of the router folder
```js
import { createBrowserRouter } from 'react-router-dom';
import { Errors } from '../components';
import defaultRoutes from './default';
import privateRoutes from './private';
  

const router = createBrowserRouter([
  ...defaultRoutes,
  ...privateRoutes,
  {
    path: '*',
    element: <Errors.NotFound />,
  },
]);


export default router;
```
1. **Import Statements:**
    
    - `import { createBrowserRouter } from 'react-router-dom';`: This line imports the `createBrowserRouter` function from the `react-router-dom` package. This function is used to create a router instance.
    - `import { Errors } from '../components';`: This imports the `Errors` component from a file located in the `../components` directory.
    - `import defaultRoutes from './default';`: This imports an array of default routes from a file named `default.js` (located in the same directory as this file).
    - `import privateRoutes from './private';`: Similarly, this imports an array of private routes from a file named `private.js`.
2. **Router Configuration:**
    
    - `const router = createBrowserRouter([...]);`: This line creates a router instance using the `createBrowserRouter` function.
    - Inside the function call, an array of route objects is provided:
        - `...defaultRoutes`: This spreads the default routes into the array.
        - `...privateRoutes`: Similarly, the private routes are spread into the array.
        - `{ path: '*', element: <Errors.NotFound /> }`: This is a catch-all route. If none of the other routes match, the `Errors.NotFound` component will be rendered. The `path: '*'` means any URL will match this route.
3. **Export:**
    
    - `export default router;`: This exports the `router` object (which represents the configured router) as the default export from this module.
4. **Usage:**
    
    - In your application, you would likely use this `router` configuration within your main application file (e.g., `App.js` or `index.js`). You’ll integrate it with your UI components to handle navigation based on the specified routes.
5. **React Router-DOM:**
    
    - The `react-router-dom` library provides tools for creating declarative routing in React applications. It allows you to define routes, handle navigation, and render different components based on the current URL.


**After configuring the root router, it can now be imported in the main file and use as a router for the whole app.**
`main.jsx`

```js
// ...other imports
import router from './routes';

  

ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root')).render(
  <React.StrictMode>
      <RouterProvider router={router} />
  </React.StrictMode>
);
```

1. **Import Statements:**
    
    - `import router from './routes';`: This line imports the `router` configuration that we previously discussed. The `router` contains information about your application’s routes (such as default routes and private routes).
2. **Rendering the Application:**
    
    - `ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root')).render(...)`: This line sets up the root of your React application. It uses `createRoot` (a new feature in React 18) to create a root element where your entire application will be rendered.
    - Inside the `render(...)` method, we have the following:
        - `<React.StrictMode>`: This is a wrapper component provided by React. It helps catch potential problems and enforces best practices during development.
        - `<RouterProvider router={router} />`: This component is part of the routing system. It receives the `router` configuration we imported earlier. The `RouterProvider` ensures that your components can access routing information (e.g., current route, navigation methods).
3. **Overall Purpose:**
    
    - The code sets up your application’s root element, enables strict mode for development, and provides the routing context via the `RouterProvider`.
    - With this setup, your components can now use routing features (such as rendering different content based on the current route) using the specified `router`.
