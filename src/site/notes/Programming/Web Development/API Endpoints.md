> [!important] Endpoints
> Endpoints in an API (Application Programming Interface) are *specific paths* or **URLs** where particular resources or services can be accessed. Each endpoint corresponds to a specific function or resource in the API and is typically associated with an HTTP method (such as **GET, POST, PUT, DELETE**) that defines the type of operation to be performed.
